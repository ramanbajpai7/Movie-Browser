# Movie Search and Favorites App

This is a Movie Search and Favorites App built using React. The app allows users to search for movies by title and manage their favorite movies. Users can filter movies by genre, release year, and rating range, and the movies are dynamically updated as the user interacts with the filters.

## Features

- Search movies by title.
- Add/remove movies to/from favorites.
- Dynamic filtering by:
  - Genre
  - Release year range
  - Rating range
- Infinite scrolling for loading more movies as the user scrolls.
- Persistent favorite list using local storage.

## Technologies Used

- *React*: Frontend UI and application logic.
- *Axios*: For fetching movie data from the OMDB API.
- *CSS*: For styling the application with responsive design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- *Node.js*: [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- *npm*: npm comes bundled with Node.js.

### Installation

1. *Clone the repository*:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-app.git
   

2. *Navigate to the project directory*:

   bash
   cd movie-app
   

3. *Install dependencies*:

   Run the following command to install the required dependencies.

   bash
   npm install
   

### Running the App

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application on your local server.

*Deploy*:https://profound-creponne-8e820b.netlify.app/---[*From chrome settings allow insecure content for this site. Root cause for the issue is http and HTTPS mixed content site is served as http and netlify with https.*]

1. *Start the development server*:

   bash
   npm start
   

2. *Open the app in your browser*:

   Once the server is up, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

### OMDB API Key

The app uses the [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch movie data. You will need to sign up and obtain your API key if you want to run the app.

1. Visit [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to get your API key.
2. Replace the API key in the fetchMovies function inside MovieList.js file:

   js
   const response = await axios.get("http://www.omdbapi.com/", {
     params: {
       apikey: "YOUR_OMDB_API_KEY",
       s: query, // Search query
       page: page,
     },
   });
   

### Code Structure

- *src/*
  - components/
    - MovieList.js: The main component that handles movie fetching, displaying, and managing favorites.
    - MovieCard.js: A component to display individual movie cards.
  - App.js: The entry point of the React app.
  - App.css: Global styles.
  - index.js: The main entry point for React rendering.
  - MovieList.css: Styles specific to the MovieList component.
  - MovieCard.css: Styles specific to the MovieCard component.

### Future Enhancements

- Add more filters (e.g., language, actors).
- Implement pagination for movie results.
- Improve UI with better UI frameworks like Material UI or Tailwind CSS.

### Troubleshooting

- *API Key Error*: Ensure that you have replaced the OMDB API key in the MovieList.js file. If the API key is invalid or missing, the movie search won't work.
  
- *Slow Load*: If there is slow loading or issues with infinite scroll, ensure you have a stable internet connection for fetching movie data.
